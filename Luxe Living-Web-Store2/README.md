# Web Store Project

A fully functional web store created as part of a React Capstone project. This application allows users to browse products, register, log in, manage a shopping cart, and choose shipping options, all while providing a smooth and intuitive user experience.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up a local copy of the project for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - Required to run the application
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) - Comes with Node.js to manage dependencies
- A modern web browser for testing the app

### Installing

Follow these steps to set up the development environment:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web-store.git
   cd web-store
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

This will launch the application at `http://localhost:3000`.
